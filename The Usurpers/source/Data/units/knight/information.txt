peasant soldier bowman
Drafted from the higher societies of the kingdom, equipped with sword and shields and wearing fine heavy armor. They are very effective against bowmen and also beats more lightly equipped soldiers. Heavy armor sadly makes them to slow to evade catapult fire and they are vulnerable against cavalry.
